Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the- ((minus) key). For example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|- key instead of the minus key. If you enter 1000 and then hit the +|- key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\n","\n","An important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\n","problem without needing to reenter all of the other data.
