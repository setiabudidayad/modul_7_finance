Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will pay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year from now if they deposit $\\$1,000$ in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\n","turns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is $\\$1,040$. The additional $\\$40$ that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that time. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the principal) of $\\$1,000$ and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\n","$$\n","\\text{Interest Earned = \\$1,000 X 0.04 = \\$40.00}\n","$$\n","\n","By taking the interest earned amount of $\\$40$ and adding it to the original principal of $\\$1,000$, you will arrive at a total value of $\\$1,040$ in the bank account at the end of the year.

Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that $\\$1,040$ represents the future value of $\\$1,000$ one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss interest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can consider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds and/or charged to the borrower of these same funds.

The interest rate is often referred to as the **growth rate**, or the annual percentage increase on savings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula $(1 + r)^n $ will yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result of this process, as n (time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase. Also, as r (interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases.
