Again, this is because money can be saved or invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments that will generate interest income over time, thus resulting in increased savings and dollar values as time passes.\n","\n","### **Inflation**\n","The entire concept of TVM exists largely due to the presence of inflation. Inflation is defined as a general increase in the prices of goods and services and/or a drop in the value of money and its purchasing power.\n","\n","The purchasing power of the consumer dollar is a statistic tracked by the part of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and is part of the consumer price index (CPI) data that is periodically published by that government agency.

One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it is preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\n","inflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending money later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing power of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move into the future.\n","\n","Most investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a payment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general prices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of normal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value of financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\n","may be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than inflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power. Conversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\n","as time goes by under such conditions."],"metadata":{"id":"vIIVQP8ibIqa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **The Impact of Inflation on TVM**\n","The difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the effects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods and services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that increasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\n","available will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services. When more money is created and made available to the consuming public, the value of each unit of currency will diminish.\n","\n","This will then have the effect of incentivizing consumers to spend their money now, or in the very near future, instead of saving cash for later use. Another concept in economics states that this relationship between **money supply** and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the **Federal Reserve** might at times take steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to increased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the costs of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\n","\n","Consumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it now, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a decision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\n","inflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in times when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing power erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\n","now in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through interest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\n","\n","Lower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed as the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on to sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money less expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and services they may require. We have also seen that the more quickly inflation rates rise, the more quickly the general purchasing power of money will be eroded. Rational investors who set money aside for the future will demand higher interest rates to compensate them for such periods of inflation. However, investors who save\n","for future consumption but leave their money **uninvested** or **underinvested** in low-interest-bearing accounts will essentially lose value from their financial assets because each of their future dollars will be worth less,\n","carrying less purchasing power when they end up needing it for use.

Nominal rates are “stated,” not adjusted for the effects of inflation. In order to determine more practical **real interest rates**, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation\n","rate, such as those that are calculated and published by the **Bureau of Labor Statistics** within the **consumer price index (CPI)**.\n","\n","A concept referred to as the **Fisher effect**, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship between inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{(1 + i) = (1 + R) x (1 + h)}\n","$$\n","\n","where i is the nominal interest rate, R is the real interest rate, and h is the expected inflation rate.\n","\n","An example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest rate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%.

A person who holds money in the form of cash is actually losing future purchasing value when real interest rates are negative. A saver who decides to hold $\\$1,000$ in the form of cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% per year will lose $\\text{\\$1,000 x - 0.0365}$ or $\\$36.50$, in purchasing power by the end of that year.\n","\n","Ordinarily, interest rates would rise to compensate for negative real rates, but this might not happen if the Federal Reserve takes steps to maintain low interest rates to help stimulate and stabilize the economy. When\n","interest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due to their extremely poor returns.\n","\n","It soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and direct impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is therefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our savings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\n","\n","### **Compounding Interest**\n","As we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In cases of **compounding interest**, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned interest income will continue to grow with each **compounding period**. So, for example, if you have $\\$1,000$ in a savings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of five years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $\\$1,100$. This comprises the original principal of $\\$1,000$ plus $\\$100$ in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\n","total amount from the previous compounding period—the $\\$1,100$ amount.\n","\n","So, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $\\$1,210$ ($\\$1,100$ plus $\\$110$ in interest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $\\$1,000$ will have grown to approximately $\\$1,610$. Now, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this scenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves you in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the time value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\n","saving and investing.\n","\n","It is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples we have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even continuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the future value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial  instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\n","all other variables are constant.\n","\n","The math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of rate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\n","\n","For example, $\\$1,000$ invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n","$\\text{\\$1,000 x (1.06)$^1$}$ $\\text{= \\$1,060.00}$.\n","But that same $\\$1,000$ invested for that same period of time—one year—and earning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to $\\text{\\$1,000 x (1.005)$^{12}$}$ $\\text{= \\$1,061.67}$,  because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6% rate. Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period\n","\n","$\\frac{\\text{0.06 annual interest}}{\\text{12 months in a year}} = 0.005$\n","\n","andnas the number of periods (12 months in a year;$\\text{12 x 1 = 12}  $ ) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\n","\n","\n","Continuing with our example, that same $\\$1,000$ in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four times a year, would grow to\n","$\\text{\\$1,000 x (1.05)$^4$}$ $\\text{= \\$1,061.36} $\n","in one year. Note that this final amount ends up\n","being greater than the annually compounded future value of $\\$1,060.00$ and slightly less than the monthly compounded future value of $\\$1.061.67$, which would appear to make logical sense.\n","\n","The total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples are insignificant, amounting to less than $\\$1.70$ in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher interest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency\n","become far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.\n","\n","Ten million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to\n","$\\text{\\$10,000 x (1.12) = \\$11,200.00}$\n",", while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will\n","produce $\\text{\\$10,000,000 x (1.03)$^4$}$ $\\text{= \\$11,255,088.10}$. Most wealthy and rational investors and savers would be very pleased to earn that additional $\\$55,088.10$ by simply having their funds in an account that features quarterly compounding.\n","\n","In another example, $\\$200$ at 60% interest, compounded annually for six years, becomes $\\text{\\$200 x (1.6)$^6$}$ $\\text{= \\$3,355.44}$, while this same amount compounded quarterly grows to\n","$\\text{\\$200 x (1.15)$^{24}$}$ $\\text{ = \\$5,725.04}$\n","\n","An amount of $\\$1$ at 3%, compounded annually for 100 years, will be worth $\\text{\\$1 x (1.03)$^{100}$}$ $\\text{ = \\$19.22}$.

The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time to double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth rate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not as a percentage. So, as a result, we have\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Years for an Amount to Double = $\\frac{72}{\\text{Interest or Growth Rate}}$}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","This formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for understanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary balance.\n","\n","Following are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very easily, often enabling you to solve them “in your head,” without the need for a calculator or spreadsheet.\n","\n","Let’s say you are interested in knowing how long it will take your savings account balance to double. If your account earns an interest rate of 9%, your money will take or 8, years to double. However, if you are earning only 6% on this same investment, your money will take , or 12, years to double.\n","\n","Now let’s say you have a specific future purchasing need and you know that you will need to double your money in five years. In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of , or 14.4%. Through these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can have significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\n","\n","To further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s **gross domestic product** is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will take the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\n","\n","Now, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in 72/2, or 36, years. However, if the rate of growth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in 72/11, or 6.55, years.  By performing such calculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\n","growth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation and development.\n","\n","It is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings amounts that are earning interest.\n","\n","To apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers would lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling in 72/3, or 24, years as compared to 72/2, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\n","\n","Now, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to be greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in 72/7, or about 10.3,\n","years.\n","\n","In an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of 24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\n","you owe to the credit card company will double in only 72/24, or 3, years.\n","\n","So, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage point in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic forecasting models.\n","\n","It is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an amount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good nonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\n","in a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of facilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in 72/2 or 36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only 72/3, or 24, years.

Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money in exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk and return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.\n","\n","Risk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up earning more than that single dollar.\n","\n","To summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important because they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their money today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that\n","inflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects of inflation.\n","\n","## **Opportunity Costs**\n","The concept of **opportunity cost** arises from the idea that there will always be possible options that are sacrificed with every option we decide on or for every choice that we make. For example, let’s consider the decision to go to college after you graduate from high school. This decision, as with just about any other, will\n","involve evaluating opportunity costs. If you choose to go to college, this will result in your sacrificing four years of potential earnings that you could have had if you had decided to take a job instead of attending school. Also, in addition to the lost salary, you would be losing out on four years of work experience that could have had a positive impact on your résumé or your future earnings prospects.\n","\n","Of course, the entire idea behind furthering one’s education is that you are hopeful that by choosing to go to college, you will increase the likelihood of earning a greater salary over the course of your lifetime than you would have if you had chosen to join the workforce directly out of high school. So, this ends up being a bit of a\n","risk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the road than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies. When it comes to opportunity costs and the time value of money, it is obvious that there will always be costs associated with every forgone financial opportunity we pass on when we make a different choice. The logical individual can only hope that\n","these choices produce a better end result than if we had made different choices and pursued any of our forgone alternatives. This also applies in situations where we may sit idly by and decide to take no action at all.\n","\n","For example, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an opportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return.
